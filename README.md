# Node / React boilerplate

This boilerplate is meant to solve the issues repeating the same process of configuring development,
production and authentication processes when starting a new application. 

While I do try to follow community standards, I'm always open to suggestions and critique.
If you believe something requires changing, open an issue and I'll gladly review it. :)
